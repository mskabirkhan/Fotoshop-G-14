# Fotoshop-G-14
This is a simple fotoshop software prototype that uses command line to manipulate images. This software is in its primary stage which includes bug and errors. Group 14 made this project reusable, maintainable and refactor the old code to meet the project ambition!

Group 14, School of Computer Science 18/19, University of Hertfordshire.
